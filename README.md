# get_next_line

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line
ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

Only 3 functions allowed to use from libc library: read, malloc, read.
But it's possible to use functions from libft library.

In the header file get_next_line.h we must have at least the prototype of the
function get_next_line and a macro that allows to choose the size of the reading
buffer for the read function. That macro must be named BUFF_SIZE.
